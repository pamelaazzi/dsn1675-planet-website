  <h2>Venus</h2>
  Venus is the second planet from the Sun, orbiting it every 224.7 Earth days. Venus is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called Earth's "sister planet" because of their similar size, gravity, and bulk composition. However, it has also been shown to be radically different from Earth in other respects.
